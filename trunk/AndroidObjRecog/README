Dependencies:
0. Android sdk
1. crystax's patched ndk with stl support
2. android-opencv
3. So far only proven to build on linux

I'll assume you are familiar with the android sdk... out of laziness on my part :)

The android ndk 1.6 doesn't support most of stl so to build the native 
library you must use an unsupported build of the NDK 
 available here -
 	http://crystax.net/androidndk.php

I am building this on 64 bit Ubuntu 9.10 linux and used the linux-x86 build of the ndk
from crystax - http://crystax.net/data/android-ndk-1.6_r1-linux-x86-crystax.tar.bz2
just untar and then cd to the directory.  From there run build/host-setup.sh and you can
use it just like the other ndk but now with std::vector<IpPoint> and such.

Grab opencv with git

git clone git://github.com/billmccord/OpenCV-Android

ln -s <opencv directory> <ndk directory>/apps/opencv

then from ndk directory do 

make APP=opencv

That should make opencv.... 

Ok. I use swig to generate the jni wrappers... grab swig if you don't have it.  The swig wrappers are already
generated but, if you change code, rerun the swig.sh in the jni directory.

make a soft link to the OpenAndroid Surf directory in the apps dir of the ndk.

ln -s path/to/OpenAndroidSurf/ <ndk>/apps/OpenAndroidSurf

now run make APP=OpenAndroidSurf from the ndk root directory.

this will put OpenSURF.lib in the lib/armabi/ directory. Make sure to copy the opencv.lib to this directory also.

goodluck, these instructions are probably incomplete and haven't been tested.  let me know if you have issues.
